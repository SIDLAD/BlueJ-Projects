- chat_2 and chat_2obj: Awen Irving aka AI(not actually an AI) is a chatbot 
that I had created in 10th grade, it can do quite a few things, like answer
generic questions, learn answers for questions(the phrasing doesn't even 
have to be exact) that it doesn't have the answer to, display poems and 
short stories, and has a convenient in-built calculator too!

- fibonacci, pascal triangle: self-explanatory

-others : random stuff
